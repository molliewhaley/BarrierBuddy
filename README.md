## BarrierBuddy

### Desciption 
BarrierBuddy is a transformative iOS app designed to make traveling hassle free. It leverages VisionKit and LibreTranslate to quickly detect and translate between different languages. Conversions are provided by exchangerate.host Api to get the most accurate reflection of current exchange rates. With these dynamic tools, this simple app has powerful capabilities. 

## Inspiration 
I’ve been solo traveling through Europe this past month and have experienced quite a few language barriers so I decided to create an app that would help me on my travels. BarrierBuddy combines the two most useful features I’ve needed into one app - a camera scanner for signs, menus, and other written text and a currency converter to change between currencies so I know how much items cost in my native currency. This app has simplified my traveling between and within countries significantly.
