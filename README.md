## BarrierBuddy

### Description 
Traveling to a foreign country is an empowering experience, but it doesnâ€™t always feel like it when you can't understand a word in sight. This can be overwhelming, but not anymore! BarrierBuddy is designed for all of the tough situations of not knowing what to say or how much to pay. It's equipped with a camera scanner for signs, menus, and other written text and a currency converter to change between currencies so you know just how much items cost. It takes care of the confusion so that you can freely experience all the world has to offer. 

### Inspiration 
I've been solo travelling Europe for the first time and have had to learn a lot of things the hard way. Some of the words and prices are intuitive, but not always. It feels like as soon as I start getting comfortable with phrases and costs of things, I have to hope on a plane and start all over again. I created this app to combine the two barriers I have run into most so that I can focus on the things that matter.
